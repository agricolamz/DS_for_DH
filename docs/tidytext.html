<p>Тексты хранятся в интернете по разному. Часто бывает так, что текст дигитализировали так, как он напечатан, так что в результате каждая строка в печатной книжке соответствует строке в текстовом файле (так, например, в нашем примере). Такой файл следует склеить воедино, используя пробел в качестве разделителя:</p>

He lived","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"mutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"some days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"well in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mr. Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"always did him good; and his many inquiries after \"poor Isabella\" and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Woodhouse gratefully observed, \"It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to come out at this late hour to call upon us.

It was a concern which","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"brought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of his","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"life passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time, realised an easy","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"competence--enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Highbury, which he had always longed for--enough to marry a woman as","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"his own friendly and social disposition.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"but he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"accomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"his wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through.

It was most unlikely, therefore,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"that he should ever want his father's assistance. His father had no","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"apprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"believed, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year in London, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too.

Now","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hope","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"mother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"has written to Mrs. Weston?

She felt herself a most","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"she might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"who could ill bear to part with her.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour's ennui,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"character; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"have been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"privations. And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and in Mr. Weston's disposition and circumstances, which would make the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the week together.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction--her more","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"at his being still able to pity 'poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"own.

He had been at the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"pains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject.

Quick","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking companion, Emma had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very early foreseen how useful she might find her. In that respect","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. Weston's loss had been important. Her father never went beyond the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston's marriage","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her exercise had been too much confined. She had ventured once alone to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"one whom she could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuable","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"addition to her privileges. But in every respect, as she saw more of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her kind designs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"guided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was very amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"want of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"young friend she wanted--exactly the something which her home required.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"never be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem. Harriet","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs. Weston there","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"were the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tell","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never believe that in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth. Harriet","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"had no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the school in general, formed naturally a great part of the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"conversation--and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Abbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupied","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"talkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"exultation of Mrs. Martin's having \"_two_ parlours, two very good","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"parlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"drawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"five-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"them Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"cow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"it should be called _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"summer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"drink tea:--a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"people.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"cause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"arose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"daughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"appeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"always mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"something or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Martin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were not","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"obliging. He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them, and in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"every thing else he was so very obliging. He had his shepherd's son into","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her. She was very fond","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of singing. He could sing a little himself. She believed he was very","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"clever, and understood every thing. He had a very fine flock, and, while","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"she was with them, he had been bid more for his wool than any body in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the country. She believed every body spoke well of him. His mother and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"there was a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married, he","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"would make a good husband. Not that she _wanted_ him to marry. She was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in no hurry at all.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Well done, Mrs. Martin!\" thought Emma. \"You know what you are about.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"seen.

Then, here come all my","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"attempts at three of those four children;--there they are, Henry and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"them might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have them","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"or four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"any likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"coarser featured than any of mama's children ever were. Here is my","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sketch of the fourth, who was a baby.

He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That's very","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa is very","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"good.

No husbands and wives,\" with so interesting a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"consciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"leave them together at once.

But there was no","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"touch.

I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"better sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"purpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"thing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"brother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to me","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"could not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"him away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not appear","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Goddard's to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without thinking","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"him at all a tiresome wretch.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Pray, Mr. Knightley,\" said Emma, who had been smiling to herself","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"through a great part of this speech, \"how do you know that Mr. Martin","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"did not speak yesterday?\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Certainly,\" replied he, surprized, \"I do not absolutely know it; but it","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"may be inferred.

What are","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"certainly no respectable relations. She is known only as parlour-boarder","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"at a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"information. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she can have","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely ever to have","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on his account,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him. I felt that,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse. But I","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"being no harm in her, to her having that sort of disposition, which, in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"good hands, like his, might be easily led aright and turn out very well.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side; and had not the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there would be a general cry-out","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"upon her extreme good luck. Even _your_ satisfaction I made sure of.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"leaving Highbury, for the sake of her being settled so well.

Perhaps they","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still, however,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"on the wretched moment. She had never been quite well since the time of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"their daughter's marriage; and till she should have completely recovered","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"seemed, under the most favourable circumstances, to require something","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"tolerable comfort.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not told.

Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerly","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in which","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her conscience could not quite acquit her. But \"she could never get","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was such","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"coldness and reserve--such apparent indifference whether she pleased or","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not--and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"they were to be so intimate--because their ages were the same, every","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"body had supposed they must be so fond of each other.\" These were her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"reasons--she had no better.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"It was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"by fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"considerable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years'","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating. Jane","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"highest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such as almost","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall; her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium, between","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all this; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"then, her face--her features--there was more beauty in them altogether","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasing","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"beauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"needed no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty, of which elegance was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour, by all her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person or of mind,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"she saw so little in Highbury. There, not to be vulgar, was distinction,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and merit.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"justice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer. When","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"she took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her beauty;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"when she considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed impossible","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"well-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the highly","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"so naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be more","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her imagination","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"had suggested at first. If it were love, it might be simple, single,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"successless love on her side alone. She might have been unconsciously","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his conversation with her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"friend; and from the best, the purest of motives, might now be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"laborious duty.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that she","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"could wish to scheme about for her.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"These were charming feelings--but not lasting.

The aunt was as tiresome as ever; more","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of her powers; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how small a slice","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"air of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"superior performance. She was, besides, which was the worst of all, so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"cold, so cautious! There was no getting at her real opinion. Wrapt up in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"a cloak of politeness, she seemed determined to hazard nothing. She was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved on","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She seemed bent","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, or her own value","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. It was all","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"It did her no service however. Her caution was thrown away. Emma saw","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"its artifice, and returned to her first surmises. There probably _was_","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"something more to conceal than her own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"had been very near changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"The like reserve prevailed on other topics.

Miss","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!\" which instantly burst forth,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation. As the blow was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she had to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"tell. \"She had set out from Mrs. Goddard's half an hour ago--she had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"been afraid it would rain--she had been afraid it would pour down","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"every moment--but she thought she might get to Hartfield first--she","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"had hurried on as fast as possible; but then, as she was passing by the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"house where a young woman was making up a gown for her, she thought she","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"would just step in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to stay half a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and she did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"she could, and took shelter at Ford's.\"--Ford's was the principal","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"woollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher's shop united; the shop","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"first in size and fashion in the place.--\"And so, there she had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"set, without an idea of any thing in the world, full ten minutes,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"perhaps--when, all of a sudden, who should come in--to be sure it was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"so very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford's--who should come in, but","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Elizabeth Martin and her brother!--Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think.

I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and took no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"shop; and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh! dear; I was so miserable!","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"I am sure I must have been as white as my gown.

I am sure they were talking of me; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me--(do","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"you think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)--for presently she came forward--came","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"quite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"if I would. She did not do any of it in the same way that she used; I","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to be very","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but I know no","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"more what I said--I was in such a tremble!--I remember she said she","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind! Dear, Miss","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was beginning to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"away--and then--only think!--I found he was coming up towards me","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"too--slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"so he came and spoke, and I answered--and I stood for a minute, feeling","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"dreadfully, you know, one can't tell how; and then I took courage, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"said it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"three yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"stables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain. Oh!","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"dear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I said, I was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very much obliged to him: you know I could not do less; and then he went","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"back to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables--I believe I did--but","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"I hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"I would rather done any thing than have it happen: and yet, you know,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"so kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"make me comfortable again.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her power.

The young man's conduct, and his sister's, seemed","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them. As Harriet","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"described it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and genuine delicacy in their behaviour.

Sometimes Mr. Elton","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"predominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally useful","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as a check to the other.

The unhappiness produced by the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Martin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's a few days afterwards.

It would hold the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very number for comfort. They ought to have balls there at least every","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"fortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the former good old days of the room?--She who could do any thing in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Highbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. He could not be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"were given and families described, he was still unwilling to admit that","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that there","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"would be the smallest difficulty in every body's returning into their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"proper place the next morning.

Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"indifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"mind.

He","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"appeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great deal","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"talking of him--said he would be the best man in the world if he were","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"left to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"acknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"speak of her with respect. This was all very promising; and, but for","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"had given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of being at least very near it, and saved only by her own","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"indifference--(for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"honour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"acquaintance.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"have some weight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"extremely--thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"much to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"harshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, \"all young people would have their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"little whims.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"leniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for the little excesses of such a handsome young man--one who smiled so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles--Mr. Knightley.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment, he was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"over a newspaper he held in his hand, \"Hum! just the trifling, silly","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"fellow I took him for.\" She had half a mind to resent; but an instant's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularly","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"opportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make Emma","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted exactly","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the advice they gave.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Highbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in trade,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and only moderately genteel. On their first coming into the country,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping little","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"brought them a considerable increase of means--the house in town had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"yielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them. With","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"their wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house, their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"inclination for more company. They added to their house, to their number","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this time were,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in fortune and style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"single men, had already taken place. The regular and best families Emma","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"could hardly suppose they would presume to invite--neither Donwell, nor","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Hartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt _her_ to go, if they did;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and she regretted that her father's known habits would be giving","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coles were very","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was not","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"them. This lesson, she very much feared, they would receive only from","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"herself; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"invitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Weston's accounting for it with \"I suppose they will not take the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"liberty with you; they know you do not dine out,\" was not quite","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sufficient. She felt that she should like to have had the power of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"refusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled there,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her, occurred","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"again and again, she did not know that she might not have been tempted","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses. They","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence. Might","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his. The bare","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission to be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her first","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"remark, on reading it, was that \"of course it must be declined,\" she so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do, that their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"advice for her going was most prompt and successful.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"without inclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"properly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--so much","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"consideration for her father. \"They would have solicited the honour","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of his company.\" Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; and it being","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"his comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates, might be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"depended on for bearing him company--Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"into an acquiescence of his daughter's going out to dinner on a day now","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"near at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him. As for _his_","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"going, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours would be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"too late, and the party too numerous. He was soon pretty well resigned.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"I am not fond of dinner-visiting,\" said he--\"I never was. No more is","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"should have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us--take us","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in their afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"reasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"evening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"body to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"with them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"care of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.\" Then turning to Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Weston, with a look of gentle reproach--\"Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"married, you would have staid at home with me.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Well, sir,\" cried Mr. Weston, \"as I took Miss Taylor away, it is","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Goddard in a moment, if you wish it.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation. The ladies knew better how","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"arranged.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as usual. \"He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had a great regard","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her. James","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"could take the note.

You may guess","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I made","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage would be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"at her service before it took us home; for I thought it would be making","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"may be sure. 'Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'--but with many,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"many thanks--'there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.' I was quite","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"surprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized. Such a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--the sort of thing","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"that so few men would think of. And, in short, from knowing his","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"usual ways, I am very much inclined to think that it was for their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"accommodation the carriage was used at all. I do suspect he would not","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"have had a pair of horses for himself, and that it was only as an excuse","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for assisting them.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Very likely,\" said Emma--\"nothing more likely. I know no man more","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any thing","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Fairfax's ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;--and for","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"more than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day--for we arrived","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"together; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"could betray.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Well,\" said Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"you give him credit for more simple,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while Miss","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have never","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"been able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more probable","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"it appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Fairfax.

I cannot at all consent to Mr. Knightley's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely.

He has a great regard for the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax--and is always glad to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"shew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to match-making.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!--Oh! no,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"no;--every feeling revolts.

'Not that it was such a very old petticoat either--for still","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"it would last a great while--and, indeed, she must thankfully say that","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"their petticoats were all very strong.'\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against my conscience.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"by Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him. She might talk on; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would only talk louder, and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"drown her voice. But the question is not, whether it would be a bad","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"connexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and I think he does. I have","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"heard him speak, and so must you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax! The","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"interest he takes in her--his anxiety about her health--his concern that","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"she should have no happier prospect! I have heard him express himself","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"so warmly on those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"pianoforte, and of her voice! I have heard him say that he could listen","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to her for ever. Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody--though","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley?

Frank Churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been seeing nothing, except that","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr. Cole, to add his very","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it suited Emma best to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"lead, she gave a very proper compliance.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the little things which are generally acceptable, and could accompany","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her own voice well. One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"surprize--a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill. Her","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"pardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and every thing usual","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"followed. He was accused of having a delightful voice, and a perfect","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"knowledge of music; which was properly denied; and that he knew nothing","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly asserted. They sang","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"together once more; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she never could","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her own.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"numbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. But the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma's mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united voices","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"gave only momentary interruptions. Her objections to Mr. Knightley's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"marrying did not in the least subside. She could see nothing but evil","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John Knightley;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"consequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children--a most","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"mortifying change, and material loss to them all;--a very great","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"deduction from her father's daily comfort--and, as to herself, she could","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Knightley for them all to give way to!--No--Mr. Knightley must never","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"marry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. They","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"talked at first only of the performance. His admiration was certainly","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"struck her. As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of his","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it to indicate only","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"I often feel concern,\" said she, \"that I dare not make our carriage","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"more useful on such occasions.

Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is not","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"enhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I should have","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"had no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he were","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"entirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there were no actual","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"preference--remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of Jane's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"second song, her voice grew thick.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"That will do,\" said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud--\"you have","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Another song, however, was soon begged for. \"One more;--they would not","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"And Frank Churchill was heard to say, \"I think you could manage this","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"without effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strength of the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"song falls on the second.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mr. Knightley grew angry.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"That fellow,\" said he, indignantly, \"thinks of nothing but shewing off","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"his own voice.

Go, and interfere. They have no mercy on","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"be grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"singing. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss Woodhouse","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon (within","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"five minutes) the proposal of dancing--originating nobody exactly knew","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"where--was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. Mrs. Weston,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an irresistible","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"waltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming gallantry to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Knightley. This would be a trial. He was no dancer in general. If he","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"something. There was no immediate appearance. No; he was talking to Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Cole--he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not more than","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"it made it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"partner.

How","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"do you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs. Weston","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are--\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.--Oh!","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very happy to see her--and now we are such a nice party, she cannot","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"refuse.--'Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill, 'Miss Woodhouse's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"opinion of the instrument will be worth having.'--But, said I, I shall","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.--'Oh,' said","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"he, 'wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;'--For, would you","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the world, fastening in the rivet of my mother's spectacles.--The rivet","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"came out, you know, this morning.--So very obliging!--For my mother had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"no use of her spectacles--could not put them on. And, by the bye, every","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"body ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane said","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time Patty came","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Patty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet of your","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"mistress's spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Wallises, always--I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never known any thing","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"but the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be for the value","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know?","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Only three of us.--besides dear Jane at present--and she really eats","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"nothing--makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"if you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she eats--so I","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But about the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome, for I took","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"him in the street. Not that I had any doubt before--I have so often","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it is the only","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome. We","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an excellent","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"ladies will oblige us.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma would be \"very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,\" and they did at","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"came back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well--only a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"little too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"What was I talking of?\" said she, beginning again when they were all in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the street.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! my mother's","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! 'Oh!' said he,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"'I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"excessively.'--Which you know shewed him to be so very.... Indeed I must","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"say that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"he very far exceeds any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"most warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parent could....","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"'Oh!' said he, 'I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"excessively.' I never shall forget his manner. And when I brought out","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"obliging as to take some, 'Oh!' said he directly, 'there is nothing","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.' That, you know, was so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"very.... And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment. Indeed they","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice--only","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"we do not have them baked more than twice, and Mr. Woodhouse made us","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"promise to have them done three times--but Miss Woodhouse will be so","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"good as not to mention it. The apples themselves are the very finest","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell--some of Mr.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Knightley's most liberal supply. He sends us a sack every year; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"trees--I believe there is two of them. My mother says the orchard was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"always famous in her younger days. But I was really quite shocked the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"other day--for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"these apples, and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"them, and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock. 'I","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"am sure you must be,' said he, 'and I will send you another supply; for","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"I have a great many more than I can ever use. William Larkins let me","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"keep a larger quantity than usual this year. I will send you some more,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"before they get good for nothing.' So I begged he would not--for really","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as to ours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"many left--it was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for Jane; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"so liberal as he had been already; and Jane said the same. And when","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"he was gone, she almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not say","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"quarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wished","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"I had made him believe we had a great many left. Oh, said I, my dear,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"I did say as much as I could. However, the very same evening William","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same sort of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged, and went down","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"William Larkins is such an old acquaintance! I am always glad to see","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"him. But, however, I found afterwards from Patty, that William said it","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had; he had brought them","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"all--and now his master had not one left to bake or boil. William did","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not seem to mind it himself, he was so pleased to think his master had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sold so many; for William, you know, thinks more of his master's profit","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"than any thing; but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"being all sent away. She could not bear that her master should not be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"able to have another apple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"her not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"me, and I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"know any thing about it for the world! He would be so very.... I wanted","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"to keep it from Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"before I was aware.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning.

That young man (speaking lower) is very","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"thoughtless. Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the thing. He has been opening the doors very often this evening,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and keeping them open very inconsiderately. He does not think of the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"draught.

One","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"cannot resolve upon them in a hurry.

He came four times a day","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"for a week. He said, from the first, it was a very good sort--which","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint.

At the time of the ballroom's being built,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the only addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wanted","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"by their four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"supper? Another room of much better size might be secured for the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"purpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"passage must be gone through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage;","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"miserably crowded at supper.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"&c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"suggestion. A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again. She then took another line of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"I do not think it _is_ so very small.

All the rest, in speculation at","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"least, was perfectly smooth.

In my Bath","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"life, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse's spirits,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"which, I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to its","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"recommendations to _you_, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"on them. The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"understood. It would be a charming introduction for you, who have lived","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"so secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some of the best","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"society in the place. A line from me would bring you a little host of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"acquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"always resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"attentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"with.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"_introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices of a friend","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of Mrs. Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--The dignity of Miss","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could have","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; \"but their going to Bath was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced that","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the place might suit her better than her father.\" And then, to prevent","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these occasions,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"a lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long known","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"that you are a superior performer.\"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"\"Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"performer!--very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"a quarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"music--passionately fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoid","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"of taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"_mediocre_ to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"delightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"into. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life to","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"Maple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"home, and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"disagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"been accustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"_world_ I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear of","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"retirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not necessary to _me_. I could do very well without it. To those who had","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me quite","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used to, I","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"really could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal to any","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"sacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed to every","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages were not","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments. 'But,' said I,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"'to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without something of a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"musical society.

If _we_ exert ourselves, I think we shall","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"not be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would be","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"particularly desirable for _me_, as an inducement to keep me in","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"practice; for married women, you know--there is a sad story against","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"them, in general.

Her Bath habits made evening-parties","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"perfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste for","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"dinners. She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the Highbury","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"card-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were a","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon shew","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"them how every thing ought to be arranged.

After Emma had talked about it for","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself,","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"The persons to be invited, required little thought.

Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"utmost that his nerves could bear--and here would be a ninth--and Emma","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"being able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"falling in with a dinner-party.","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"representing that though he certainly would make them nine, yet","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"he always said so little, that the increase of noise would be very","3":"Emma"},{"1":"158","2":"immaterial.

Для этого книги нужно привести в tidy формат и для этого написан пакет <code>tidytext</code> (онлайн книга доступна <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/">здесь</a>). Основное “оружие” пакета <code>tidytext</code> функция <code>unnest_tokens()</code>, которая переводит текст в tidy формат. В аргумент <code>output</code> подается вектор с именем будущей переменной, а аргумент <code>input</code> принимает переменную с текстом.</p>

<p>Если мы работаем с одним фасетом, то все проблемы может решить функция <code>fct_reorder()</code>, которая упорядочивает на основании некоторой переменной:</p>
